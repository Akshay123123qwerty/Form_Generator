Dynamic Form Generator is a web-based tool designed to streamline the creation of forms based on JSON schema definitions. This project provides a flexible and user-friendly interface for users to design and generate dynamic forms in real time. It uses modern web technologies like React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and React Hook Form to create an interactive experience for building forms that can be customized and validated according to a predefined schema.

The idea is that as the user types or modifies the JSON in the editor on the left, the form on the right is automatically updated to reflect the changes.
